Reversing data structures from C/C++ binaries depends on low-level programming constructs such as structs or variables. Forensics analysis and reverse engineering are very hard if the detailed information about the pointer structures is not known. In this paper we have reviewed existing research on a tool called ”Mem-Pick” which caters this need.
