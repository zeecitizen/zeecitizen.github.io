With the fast-paced growth and increasing popularity of Augmented Reality, there is a need for input devices which can provide the possibility of interaction in a 3D user interface between human and machine. This paper aims to understand how the state-of-the-art 3D UI input devices work, and compare them to established input devices such as mouse, keyboard, joystick and so on. We have shortlisted a few input devices ranging over various modes of input, and compared them to devices which have a similar or related functionality. We have made use of various parameters such as efficiency, ease of use, cost of productions, error rates and so on, to make our comparisons.
