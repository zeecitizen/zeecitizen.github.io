Hi! I’m Zeeshan, a Java software engineer and a machine learning student. I completed my Master's of Science in Computer Science - MSc. at Technical University of Munich. I’m a computer scientist by training having professional experience in software engineering, but I have taken just enough courses in machine learning and data science to understand AI. I joined MIT as a visiting student researcher at Center for Collective intelligence where i contributed to the software development of the lab's Climate CoLab platform,
which is an online collaboration platform where thousands of experts and non-experts from all
over the world work together to develop and evaluate proposals about climate change. This led to an insight into microservices and porting legacy platform architectures to modern frameworks.

Most of my software engineering experience comprises that of me working on Java projects at different companies. My first job was as a developer at a Swiss multinational bank called Habib Bank AG Zurich. There, i implemented impactful Java projects in the financial domain. Used Java with SQL to build a centralized financial project with the  central bank of Dubai. This was done by following the formal functional specifications document and translating those risk intense requirements into fully functional banking software programs now used at the bank. My implementation replaced postdated cheques which was the norm in Dubai for past years. We achieved this by replacing paper cheques with recurring autonomous variable payments for paying house rent, utility bills and children's school fees automatically from your bank account. Thus changing real estate contracts forever for the customer's of this particular bank (abolished monthly post dated cheques for yearly rental contracts).

I joined Samsung HARMAN, Connected car division in Feb 2018 after coming back from my research stay at MIT. In this role, i learnt about navigation in cars and more specifically autonomous cars from BMW. This role has further let me grow as a Java SE as well as helped me gain insights about navigation of autonomous cars.	

I spend alot of time into aquiring more knowledge and experience in software engineering but on the side growing as a machine learning engineer. For example last year i enrolled in the MicroMaster's degree on Statistics and Datascience offered by MIT with lectures from their instructors available online. This has helped me complete two courses on:

- Probability - The Science of Uncertainty and Data. 
- Data Analysis for Social Scientists
